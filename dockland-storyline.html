	 <p> This storyline takes you through the events leading up to the decline of the area from the 18th century, through to the redevelopment of the docklands, and future development approved and under construction.</p> 
     </section>
     <section id='PreDevelopment' class='active'>
         <h3> Thriving Docklands (18th - 19th century) </h3>
         <p>Until the beginning of the 19th century, shipping was handled entirely within the Pool of London (the stretch of the River Thames between London Bridge and Limehouse). As trade and demand for ships continued to double from 1700 - 1770, and again from 1770 to 1795, the river was heavily burdened with congestion. Additionally, port industries developed for example, iron working, shipbuilding, cement ect., ship repairing  and numerous power stations and gas works. </p>
        <p>A series of enclosed dock systems were built on the north bank of the river including: West India Docks (1802), London Docks (1805), Royal Victoria Dock (1855) and Royal Albert Dock (1880) to relieve pressure. </p>
     </section>
     <section id='Declining'>
	     <h3>Decline of the Docks</h3>
         <p>Although suffering significant damage by the bombings in WWII, the docks experienced a period of resurgence in the 1950s, as part of the post-war rebuilding effort. </p>
         <p>Between 1960 and 1970, the use of larger vessels to accommodate 'containerisation' (intermodal containers i.e., between trucks and ships, making transportation of cargo more efficient) and other technological changes, rendered the docks redundant. The upstream docklands could not accomodate these much larger vessels, moving the shipping industry to deep-water ports such as Tilbury and Felixstowe.</p>
         <p>By 1980 all of London's docks were closed, leaving around 8 sq miles of land derelict and abandoned. These closures led to massive unemployment and social problems across East London. The are was left in dire need of re-development. </p>
     </section>
     <section id='LDDC'>
         <h3>London Docklands Development Corporation (1981)</h3>
         <p> For nearly 17 years between July 1981 and March 1998 the LDDC worked to secure the regeneration of the London Docklands. It was established by the Government under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. The 1980 Act requires an urban development corporation "to secure the regeneration of its area, by bringing land and buildings into effective use, encouraging the development of existing and new industry and commerce, creating an attractive environment and ensuring that housing and social facilities are available to encourage people to live and work in the area". The following are a few of the developments implemented under the LDDC.  </p>
    </section>
    <section id='EZ'>
         <h3>Enterprise Zone (1982 - 1992)</h3>
         <p>The Enterprise Zone was set up on the Isle of Dogs to attract new business investment. Companies that moved to the Enterprise Zone were entitled to 10 years rate free (tax breaks) and a fast track planning procedure. Many of the newspaper companies, moved from Central London to the Isle of Dogs in the 1980s.</p>
		 </section>
     <section id='DLR'>
         <h3> London Docklands Light Railway (DLR) opens (1987) </h3>
         <p>  Almost half the public sector cost of regenerating Docklands was devoted to transport infrastructure. Opened with just 15 stations and its first route, connecting Island Gardens with Tower Gateway and Stratford, helped transform the once-isolated Canary Wharf into a new financial centre. Additionally, there was an extension of the existing Jubilee Line to reach Canary Wharf. </p>
         
         <p> Formerly known as Crossrail, the Elizabeth line will provide crucial links to Heathrow Airport, the City, West End and the Thames Gateway. It will provide additional rail capacity to support 200,000 jobs on the Isle of Dogs. The scheme includes a new Canary Wharf station.</p>

         <h3>Canary Wharf (1991) </h3>
         <p>INSERT TEXT HERE. First companies move into Canary Wharf.
        The 5.9 million square feet of office and retail space are now leased. 28,000 people work in the whole of London Docklands (11/2000) and it is estimated that by 2005 Canary Wharf alone will have 100,000 workers. However, much of the office space in Canary Wharf remained empty until the late 1990s. The completion of the Jubilee Line in 2000 has certainly encouraged new investment in the area.</p>

     <section id='University'>
         <h3>University of East London (UEL) opens (1999) </h3>
         <p>INSERT TEXT HERE. Renowned for its sports offer and facilities, it is also one of the few London universities to provide on-campus accommodation. </p>

     <section id='ExCeL'>
         <h3>ExCeL London (2000) </h3>
         <p> The ExCeL Centre, located in the Royal Docks in East London, is expanding its exhibition and conference facilities to 1 million sq. ft., making it one of the largest centres in the UK, with a national and international draw, hosting c. 4 million people a year. It was later expanded for the 2012 Olympics. As part of the expansion, Urban Strategies  anticipates the physical, functional and economic growth of the East London region as a vibrant, mixed-use destination creating an attractive urban setting for ExCeL, capitalizing on its unique waterfront location while enhancing its competitive presence within a broader European context.</p>
		 </section>
    <section id='Silvertown'>
         <h3>Silvertown Quays (2001 - 2009)</h3>
         <p>The regeneration of Silvertown Quays, the last large site in the Royal Docks district of London, continues the effort to bring significant new development east of Canary Wharf and the Millennium Dome (o2). The 60-acre site won an international design competition hosted by the London Development Agency. The proposed network of streets and open spaces responded to the unique dockside location and provided the framework for a range of commercial (40,000m2) and residential (5,000 units) buildings along with water-based recreational facilities. The objective was to create a sustainable community that capitalised on recent investments in nearby regional transportation and open space infrastructure while employing the best environmental practices and job creation for the local community.</p>

         <h3>Open Spaces</h3>
         <p>Much of the existing open space from before the 1980s remains in the same location. However additional green space is visible throughout the area, especially between apartment blocks. The are before development was extremely polluted </p>

     <section id='Wood'>
         <h3>Woodwharf Regeneration</h3>
         <p>Canary Wharfâ€™s new neighbourhood, Wood Wharf, will provide up to 3,600 new homes, 2 million sq ft of office space, 350,000 sq ft of retail space and over nine acres of public spaces, squares and parks. There will also be a GP surgery and a school. This is a key example of a mix of uses within a small space.</p>

         <p> In under 30 years, Canary Wharf has transformed from an ambitious development at its infancy to one of the principal financial districts in the world, becoming the de facto city centre of Londonâ€™s rising East. Development continues in the area, and land use will continue to evolve. </p>
